# Methods 4: Bayesian Computational Modelling


## Overview

This course wraps up the series of methods courses. We look at modelling from a birds-eye view, introducing advanced concepts and revisiting methods introduced in earlier courses from a comprehensive Bayesian perspective. We introduce causal reasoning using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), mixture models, Gaussian processes, learn to deal with measurement error and missing data; and we revisit regression modelling, generalized linear models, multilevel modelling, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, learning to implement them using probabilistic programming.

## Materials and Literature

The course is based on the textbook *Statistical Rethinking* (2nd edition, 2020) by Richard McElreath<sup>1</sup>. Please get a copy. The book's [homepage](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) contains lots of additional resources. In particular, please install the [R package `rethinking`](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking). Slides and recordings of [the author's current course](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023) and of previous versions from [2019](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) and [2022](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) are also available.

## Flipped classroom

We will be using a so-called 'flipped classroom' in this course. This means that you are generally expected to have read the literature and watched the vidoes before coming to the lecture. The purpose of the lecture then is for you to ask questions (the more, the better!) so that we can go over the material again together, deepening and broadening our understanding of it.

## Slack workspace

In order for us to stay in contact, ask questions, and have discussions, there is a Slack workspace dedicated to this course. You will receive an invite link via Brightspace.

## Exam

- Portfolio consisting of 3 assignments
- Each assignment will require you to create an R Markdown notebook
consisting of a mix of text and code.

- Due
  1. End of week 11 (Sunday 17 March, 23:59)
  2. End of week 16 (Sunday 21 April, 23:59)
  3. End of week 19 (Sunday 12 May, 23:59)

You will receive a (short) feedback message from us on your portfolio assignments that you can use for improvements before finalizing your hand-ins.
